# FomoFactory Real-Time Stock/Crypto Price Data


## Description
This project is a mini-website that collects and displays real-time price data for 5 selected stocks or cryptocurrencies. The backend polls data every few seconds from a chosen API, stores it in a MongoDB database, and the frontend fetches the most recent 20 entries to display in a dynamic table. The frontend allows users to switch between different stocks or cryptocurrencies using a modal.
